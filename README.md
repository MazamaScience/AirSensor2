# AirSensor2 R Package

```
Utilities for working with air quality monitoring data from low-cost sensors
with a focus on small particulates (PM2.5). Initial focus is on sensors
produced by 'PurpleAir' <https://www2.purpleair.com>.
```

## Background

The **AirSensor2** package is a refactoring of the core data access and 
manipulation functionality found in the 
[AirSensor](https://mazamascience.github.io/AirSensor/) package. The goal in 
**AirSensor2** is to create a lean, generic package that is more easily 
maintained and is focused on data ingest and basic data manipulation.

While initially focused on data from PurpleAir sensors, **AirSensor2** 
aims to provide tools that can be used with a wide variety of low-cost
air quality sensors so that local communities can more easily access, QC and
visualize local air quality.

Development of the original **AirSensor** package was supported by the 
[South Coast Air Quality Management District](http://scaqmd.org)
with funds from a US EPA STAR grant. Additional support was provided by the US 
Forest Service [AirFire Research Team](https://www.airfire.org).

The **AirSensor2** is currently seeking sponsors for further development.
