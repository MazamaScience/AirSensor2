# AirSensor2 R Package

```
Utilities for working with air quality monitoring data from low-cost sensors
with a focus on small particulates (PM2.5). Initial focus is on sensors
produced by 'PurpleAir' <https://www2.purpleair.com>.
```

## Background

The **AirSensor2** package is a refactoring of the core, data access and 
manipulation functionality found in the **AirSensor** package. The goal in 
**AirSensor2** is to create a lean and generic package focused on data ingest
and basic data manipulation.

----

This R package was created with funding from the USFS 
[AirFire Research Team](https://www.airfire.org).
