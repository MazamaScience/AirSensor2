## Installation

Install the latest version from GitHub with:

`devtools::install_github('mazamascience/AirSensor2')`

## Data Models

**Synoptic data** (many measurements at a single point in time) are stored as a
tibble (modern dataframe) for easy use with **dplyr**.

**Time series data** are stored using the [MazamaTimeSeries](https://mazamascience.github.io/MazamaTimeSeries/)
**S**ingle**T**ime**S**eries (_sts_) data model:

Time series data from a single environmental sensor typically consists of multiple 
parameters measured at successive times. This data is stored in an R list 
containing two dataframes.

`sts$meta` – 1 row = unique device-deployment; cols = device/location metadata

`sts$data` – rows = UTC times; cols = measured parameters (plus an additional datetime column)


## API Keys

Many data providers require an API key before you can access their data. When
this is the case, **AirSensor2** data access functions will have an API key
argument.

The package also allows users to specify API keys once per R session using the
`setAPIKey()` function. Each data access function will require it's own named
API key. Specific names for each key are described in the function documentation.

Example usage:

```
library(AirSensor2)

setAPIKey("PurpleAir-read", "<MY_PURPLE_AIR_READ_KEY>")

WA_pas <-
  pas_createNew(
    countryCodes = "US",
    stateCodes = "WA",
    lookbackDays = 1,
    outsideOnly = TRUE
  )
```

## Function classes

The **AirSensor2** packages handles variety of data sources within the world of 
low-cost sensors with classes of functions tailored to the specifics of each
data source. Functions with names of the form `<class>_<action>()` are designed
to perform a particular _\<action>_ on a particular _\<class>_ of data.

Currently supported classes of data inclucde:

* `pas` -- **P**uruple**A**ir**S**ynoptic. Data for many PurpleAir sensors
at a specific point in time. Each _pas_ object is a simple tibble.
* `pat` -- **P**uruple**A**ir**T**imeseries. Time series data for a specific
PurpleAir sensor. Each _pat_ object is a list with two tibbles: `meta` and `data`.

## Data pipelines

We encourage people to embrace "data pipeline" style coding as encouraged by
**dplyr** and related packages. The special `%>%` operator uses the output
of one function as the first argument of the next function, thus allowing for 
easy "chaining" of results. Many of the functions supporting a particular
class take an object of that class as their first argument and return an object
of that class. As a result, they can be chained together as in:

```
Colville_Tribes_pas <-
  example_pas %>%
  pas_filter(stateCode == "WA") %>%
  pas_filter(countyName %in% c("Okanogan", "Ferry"))
```

Best of luck analyzing your local air quality data!
